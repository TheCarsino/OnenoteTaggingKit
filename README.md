A free to-use add-in to add page tagging to OneNote for the desktop. Page taggs are based on the built-in OneNote
tagging system and are shared to all connected OneNote cliens.

## Feature Summary:

* Page Tags can be added/removed from pages on-the-fly
* Search refinement using page tags (facetted search)
* Page tags are available and fully operational for all users of shared OneNote notebooks (requires add-in to be installed on OneNote clients)
* Full compatibility with built-in OneNote tagging system, even if add-in is not installed.
* Locating notes related to the OneNote page currently being viewed

For system requirements, installation instructions, and user guide (with screenshots), please see the project documentation.
